# Hello! ‚úåÔ∏è

I am Carlos Cezar De Souza Guaraldo, a 23-year-old Full Stack software developer. With over three years of experience in the IT field, I have developed strong technical skills in various projects, improving my interpersonal skills in the process. I contributed to the construction of designs, flows and application architecture. I implemented new features in the system according to the requested business rules, working together with project managers. I made bug fixes and changes according to decisions made with the project manager. I produced documentation for the developed applications and carried out preliminary homologations before sending them to clients for their approval, ensuring that their expectations were met. I assisted interns and beginners in the integration process.

My technical skills include experience in Backend technologies such as NodeJS, GO, Java Spring Boot, and Java GWT, while my Frontend skills include ReactJS, PHP Laravel, and JavaScript. I also have experience working with various databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLServer, and MariaDB, and environments such as Docker.

I have a degree in Technology in Systems Analysis and Development from the Paula Souza State Technological Education Center in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. During my education, I learned the SCRUM framework for project management and programming languages such as JAVA, JavaScript, and NodeJS.
